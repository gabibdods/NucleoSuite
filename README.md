# üåê Personal Web Server for Automated Web + Hardware Applications

A production-grade web server and GPIO control system configured to host personal web apps, automate daily tasks, and control real-world hardware. Built with React, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint on the frontend, and **Python + FastAPI + GPIO + Uvicorn** on the backend. Publicly accessible via **Cloudflare ZeroTrust**, and deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5 for low-power, high-efficiency use.

## üîå Hardware Integration: PWM Over Web

- A **PWM signal generator** was built using Python and the Raspberry Pi‚Äôs GPIO interface.
- Controlled via a RESTful web API exposed by **FastAPI**, hosted on the Pi.
- Hosted using **Uvicorn** for asynchronous performance.
- The web frontend communicates with the backend to send PWM values (e.g., duty cycle, frequency).
- Accessible from the public internet through **Cloudflare Tunnel**, with ZeroTrust authentication.

> ‚úÖ Result: Users can control PWM output (e.g., LED brightness, motor speed) directly from a web interface anywhere in the world.

## üîç Pulse Width Modulators vs. Oscillators ‚Äî What's the Difference?

To understand how this project controls hardware using GPIO, it‚Äôs important to distinguish Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) from other signal generation methods like oscillators or waveform generators.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Pulse Width Modulator (PWM)

- What It Is:
  PWM generates a digital signal that rapidly switches between ON and OFF at a fixed frequency. The key variable is the duty cycle ‚Äî the percentage of time the signal is ON during one cycle.
- Purpose in This Project:
  Used to control power delivery to devices (like LEDs, motors, servos) by varying the duty cycle, not the voltage itself.
- Use Cases:
  LED brightness control
  Motor speed regulation
  Servo positioning
  Efficient power delivery in embedded systems
- Example:
  A 1kHz PWM signal with a 25% duty cycle delivers 25% of full power on average.

### üîÑ Oscillator
- What It Is:
  An oscillator creates a continuous waveform (usually sine, square, or triangle) with a fixed amplitude and frequency.
- Key Difference from PWM:
  Oscillators are analog or high-frequency digital signal generators.
  They do not vary duty cycle ‚Äî the waveform shape and frequency are typically fixed.
  Used for clock generation, modulation, and carrier wave transmission.
- Use Cases:
  Timing circuits and clocks (e.g., quartz oscillators)
  Radio frequency (RF) communication
  Audio signal generation
  Frequency synthesizers
- Example:
  A 10MHz sine wave oscillator would continuously produce a sine wave at 10 million cycles per second, regardless of amplitude control needs.

- Selected **lgpio** for low-latency PWM control over the Pi‚Äôs GPIO pins
- Designed a secure frontend-backend communication model using HTTPS tunnels via Cloudflare
- Used **Next.js** for modular routing and React Server Components
- Enabled hardware-software integration without requiring local network access
